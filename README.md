# utility
A collection of some C++ tools I made. After copying the tools around and finding multiple incompatible copies of it in different projects, I thought that it's time to standardize.

Includes:
procedural - Classes and functions for procedural generation, including PRNG implementations, Hash functions, Simplex & Worley Noise, and maze generation.
vec - 2, 3, and 4 dimensional vectors with double-precision floating point and integer variants. Also includes Quaternion and Complex classes.
