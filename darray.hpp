/*
	The darray class stores a 1-dimensional dynamically allocated array. All memory allocation and deallocation is handled internally.
	A darray has a capacity which represents the amount of elements that can fit in the allocated space, and a size
	which can be changed to any value below the cap without performing a reallocation, but which is otherwise the same as capacity.
	The capacity and size can be set independently. Any change in the capacity will perform a reallocation, even a decrease in capacity.
	Setting the capacity to 0 will free all allocated memory belonging to the object.
	
	The copy constructor and assignment operator both call the copy constructor of each element in the list.
	
	Increasing the size to beyond the capacity will increase the cap to match the size and perform a reallocation.
	Decreasing the cap to below the size will decrease the size to match in addition to performing the reallocation.
	
	Automatic changes in capacity are usually very inefficient. Changes in capacity should all be performed manually via a call to set_cap()
